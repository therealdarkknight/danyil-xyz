Hey! Welcome to my website.

I've decided to add a writing section with the intent of sharing medium-to-long-form essays on the topics listed on the Writings page.

My first article is on a ubiquitous method that's super useful for solving challenging programming Leetcode-style problems that I haven't seen described elsewhere yet-- stay tuned!

In the meantime, enjoy this riddle while it lasts (I'm deleting this post once my first article comes out!)

> What is so fragile that saying its name breaks it?
